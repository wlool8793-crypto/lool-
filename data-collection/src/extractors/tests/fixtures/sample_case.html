            <h2>JUDGMENT</h2>
            <p><strong>Justice Md. Tafazzul Islam, J. (Majority Opinion):</strong></p>

            <p>This is an appeal against the conviction and sentence passed by the Court of Session,
            Dhaka under Section 302 of the Penal Code, 1860. The appellant was convicted for the
            murder of the deceased and sentenced to death.</p>

            <p>The facts of the case are as follows: The appellant and the deceased had a long-standing
            dispute over land. On the fateful day, they had an altercation which resulted in the
            appellant attacking the deceased with a sharp weapon.</p>

            <h3>Sections Cited</h3>
            <p>The following statutory provisions are relevant:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Section 302 of the Penal Code, 1860 - Murder</li>
                <li>Section 300 of the Penal Code, 1860 - Definition of murder</li>
                <li>Article 14 of the Constitution of Bangladesh - Equality before law</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Case Law Cited</h3>
            <p>The following precedents were considered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abdul Khaleque v. State, 18 (1993) BLD 125</li>
                <li>State v. Shamsul Haque, 15 (1990) DLR (AD) 45</li>
                <li>Ram Prasad v. State of Bihar, AIR 1975 SC 1250</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Decision</h3>
            <p>After careful consideration of the evidence and legal principles, we find that the
            conviction under Section 302 of the Penal Code is not sustainable. The prosecution
            has failed to establish the guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence are set aside.
            The appellant is acquitted of the charges.</p>

            <p><strong>Justice A.B.M. Khairul Haque, J. (Concurring Opinion):</strong></p>
            <p>I agree with the conclusion reached by my learned brother.</p>
