i went to brain stam a this project act as legal ai engier and data syitice and lawer and use defrent agent one for give proposalin text not code  and anothe agent will evalute and also 
another lawer agent evalute it according to thewre need 

● I understand you want to brainstorm a hybrid RAG system for legal applications with multiple agent perspectives. Let me clarify your requirements so I can provide the best proposal:
                                                                                                                                                
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What is the primary legal domain and use case for this hybrid RAG system? → Multi-domain
     · What retrieval strategies should the hybrid RAG system combine? → Vector/Semantic Search, Keyword/BM25, Knowledge Graph, Citation Network
     · Who are the primary users of this system? → Lawyers/Advocates, Legal Researchers, Paralegals/Clerks, General Public
     · What scale and data sources are you targeting? → Multi-jurisdiction

● Perfect! Now I'll research hybrid RAG architectures, legal AI systems, and multi-agent frameworks to create a comprehensive proposal for your multi-domain, multi-jurisdiction legal AI system.
